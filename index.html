        <h4>THE TUNNEL AT THE POWER STATION</h4>
        <p>
          Explore the fascinating history of the century-old power station from
          an incredible new perspective, 180 feet beneath the main generating
          floor. Descend into the tunnel in a glass-paneled elevator and marvel
          at the hidden decks of the power station. Discover how the station was
          excavated in 1901 with rudimentary tools such as pickaxes, shovels,
          and lanterns. Learn how it expelled the station's spent waters back
          into the Niagara River at the base of the falls. The tunnel served as
          an exit point for the water used in generating hydropower for over a
          century. Follow the same path as the water and journey through the
          tunnel to a viewing platform where the tunnel emptied into the Niagara
          River. For the first time ever, the newly constructed viewing platform
          offers unparalleled access to a new perspective of the lower Niagara
          River, with stunning views of both the Horseshoe and American Falls.
          Don't miss out on this opportunity to dig deep into history and
          witness the beauty of Niagara Falls like never before.
